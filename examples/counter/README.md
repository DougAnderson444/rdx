# RDX Counter Example

A simple counter example that demonstrates how to use RDX to manage state in a WebAssembly component plugin.

The HTML parts are built in [./build.rs](./build.rs) and the Rust parts are in [./src/lib.rs](./src/lib.rs).

A copy of the final RDX is saved at [./counter.rhai](./counter.rhai).
